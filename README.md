Simple side project to create a gui for an llm. The idea is that I have a local llm running on my home machine and I can query it remotely.

This is mostly just practice creating an app, frontend, and working with containers.

To run this, install docker compose. Then run `docker-compose build`. Then run `docker-compose up`.
